## Interactive 3D Project Viewer

<!-- 3D Viewer: works in GitHub Pages + Jekyll -->
<!-- Uses <model-viewer>, which is supported in Markdown via raw HTML -->
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@google/model-viewer/dist/model-viewer.min.js"></script>

<model-viewer
  src="/assets/models/example.glb"
  alt="3D model of engineering project"
  auto-rotate
  camera-controls
  shadow-intensity="1"
  exposure="1"
  style="width: 100%; height: 420px; background-color: #f5f5f5; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
</model-viewer>

**Instructions:** Rotate, pan, and zoom the model above. This viewer is fully compatible with GitHub Pages (Jekyll) and prints gracefully (it is automatically omitted from PDFs).
